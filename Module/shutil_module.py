Syntax same of  all


shutil.copytree(src, dst, symlinks = False, ignore = None, copy_function = copy2, ignore_dangling_symlinks = False)

Parameters:
src: string path of  source directory.
dest: string rpath of  destination.
symlinks (optional) : boolean value  depending on which the metadata of the original links or linked links will be copied to the new tree.
ignore (optional) : If ignore is given, it must be a callable that will receive as its arguments the directory being visited by copytree(), and a list of its contents, as returned by os.listdir().
copy_function (optional): default value is copy2. We can use other copy function like copy() for this parameter.
ignore_dangling_symlinks (optional) :When set to True is used to put a silence on the exception raised if the file pointed by the symlink doesnâ€™t exist.

Return Value: This method returns a string which represents the path of newly created directory.



shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False) 

Parame:  file path. Either a string or bytes object representing a path.
ignore_errors: If ignore_errors is true, errors resulting from failed removals will be ignored.

# Note: this method remove better than os when removing folders containg files



shutil.which(cmd, mode = os.F_OK | os.X_OK)
Parameters:
cmd: A string representing the file.
mode: This parameter specifies mode by which method should execute. os.F_OK tests existence of the path and os.X_OK Checks if path can be executed or we can say mode determines if the file exists and executable.


import shutil  
   
# file search  
cmd = 'anaconda'
   
# Using shutil.which() method 
locate = shutil.which(cmd) 
   
# Print result 
print(locate) #D:\Installation_bulk\Scripts\anaconda.EXE





There is also move a file shutil.move(src, dest)
