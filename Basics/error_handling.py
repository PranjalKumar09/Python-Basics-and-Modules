"""ERROR HANDLING (unexepected abnormal)
Error -> Due to program stop in Python
Execption -> (program correct) raised when some interrnal event occur change normal flow

SyntaxError	Raised by parser when syntax error is encountered. misspelled keyword missing colon or an unbalanced paranthesis
NameError	Raised when a variable is not found in local or global scope. Out of variable / Function (not found)
IndexError	Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range or other sequence types
ValueError	Raised when a function gets an argument of correct type but impro
like coverting unconvtable sting to integer when sting is not valid integer
KeyError	Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
AttributeError	Raised when attribute assignment or reference fails.
ImportError	Raised when the imported module is not found.
ZeroDivisionError	Raised when the second operand of division or modulo operation is zero.

try:
except IndexError as I:
except ValueError as T:
else:
finall: #always executed


Difference between except: and except Exception as e:
285

In the second you can access the attributes of the exception object:

>>> def catch():
...     try:
...         asd()
...     except Exception as e:
...         print e.message, e.args
... 
>>> catch()
global name 'asd' is not defined ("global name 'asd' is not defined",)
But it doesn't catch BaseException or the system-exiting exceptions SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt and GeneratorExit:

>>> def catch():
...     try:
...         raise BaseException()
...     except Exception as e:
...         print e.message, e.args
... 
>>> catch()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in catch
BaseException
Which a bare except does:

>>> def catch():
...     try:
...         raise BaseException()
...     except:
...         pass
... 
>>> catch()
>>>
